USER: The object in the image is predicted to be a **crab**.

Here are some biological facts and ecological context about this species:
Crabs are crustaceans with a thick exoskeleton and are typically found in shallow ocean waters, often near rocky crevices or coral reefs.
Starfish are echinoderms known for their star-shaped body, commonly found on the seabed in every ocean, from the tropics to cold seafloors.
Sea anemones are predatory marine animals that resemble flowers and are found attached to rocks or coral in shallow waters.

Based on this information and the image, explain:
- Key visual features that support this identification
- Typical habitat and environment
- Ecological role, feeding behavior, and movement
- Distinctive traits for accurate classification

Crabs are crustaceans with a thick exoskeleton and are typically found in shallow ocean waters, often near rocky crevices or coral reefs.
Sea anemones are predatory marine animals that resemble flowers and are found attached to rocks or coral in shallow waters.

Based on this information and the image, explain:
- Key visual features that support this identification

Crabs are crustaceans with a thick exoskeleton and are typically found in shallow ocean waters, often near rocky crevices or coral reefs.
Starfish are echinoderms known for their star-shaped body, commonly found on the seabed in every ocean, from the tropics to cold seafloors.
Sea anemones are predatory marine animals that resemble flowers and are found attached to rocks or coral in shallow waters.

Based on this information and the image, explain:
- Key visual features that support this identification
- Typical habitat and environment
- Ecological role, feeding behavior, and movement
- Distinctive traits for accurate classification

ASSISTANT: The object in the image is a small fish, which is a crab. The key visual features that support this identification include the presence of a thick exoskeleton, which is a characteristic of crabs, and the fact that it is found in shallow ocean waters, often near rocky crevices or coral reefs, which is a typical habitat for crabs. Crabs are known for their predatory behavior, feeding on small invertebrates, such as mollusks and crustaceans. They have a strong sense of smell and are able to move quickly"
